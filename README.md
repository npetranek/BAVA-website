# BAVA-website

this is strictly for compiling the necessary code needed to successfully launch a new website for british airways virtual aiarline. anything that get added needs to be approved by the owner. more to come later. please refrain from making changes to the css file. im going to worry about styling after all of the necessary content is added. in the future, you may see more html files added to the repo. ideally these are going to all be linked together.
